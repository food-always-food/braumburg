Professor,Nigel,Montgomery,,A history professor at Oxbridge University,,"But you’re not Professor Nigel Montgomery, are you?

Your real name is Brother Daniel Whetstone. You are a member of the Order of the Statarius, a secret order of monks with an academic interest in cryptozoology. You know that werewolves, vampires, witches, and myriads of other ‘supernaturals’ are all real and walking among us! While many who have discovered the existence of supernaturals hope to destroy them, the Statari simply see them as equals trying to make their way in the world. While the order is peaceful whenever possible, they are extensively trained, and will not hesitate to kill if a threat presents itself. The order is several hundred years old, and its members possess ancient and exhaustive knowledge in encyclopaedic tomes that they keep with them at all times.

Your older brother Nathan was a member of the order as well. That is, until he travelled to New York to study some church archives. Only a few days after he  arrived, he was killed in what was deemed a ‘wild animal attack,’ the title often given to werewolf fatalities on official paperwork. The death was grisly - they  weren’t able to recover all of your brother - but something about the official report didn’t sit right with you. Nathan could have finished off a werewolf or vampire without breaking a sweat, so you know he must have been taken down by something entirely unexpected.

You got a hold of the case files, and as you suspected, things weren’t what they seemed. Most disturbingly, you’ve been able to piece together that the flesh removed from Nathan corresponded with traditional cuts of meat. Yes, your brother was not only murdered, but eaten! You may have seen your share of monsters, but cannibalism is just inhuman…

You followed a trail of similar murders, which has led you to believe the cannibal murderer is based here, in Dunkeldorf. You travelled here about 2 months ago - taking on a false identity to avoid alerting the killer to your investigation. As a ‘professor,’ you can flaunt your supernatural knowledge without it seeming out of place. You managed to blag your way into staying at the Von Lucan castle (and accessing its impressive library) by pretending to have been in the Count’s Oxbridge graduating class. He didn’t call your bluff and seems to have been glad of the company.

Your main piece of evidence is the murderer’s ‘calling card’ – they leave each  victim with a white ribbon tied somewhere on their bodies - a humiliating parting  gift from a deranged killer.

You are disgusted and vengeful, and determined to find this cannibal. Your investigation has cleared everyone in town of any guilt, except those here at the castle tonight! Funny how those things work out…

Though you wish you could focus on avenging Nathan, something else has been troubling you. In the midst of some light reading in the castle library, you came across a book on the ‘Imperium Ritual’. If completed during the full moon (which  just happens to be tonight), this powerful ritual would give a witch (male or  female), control over all supernatural creatures. You’d have dismissed it as a curiosity, but as you flipped to the end of the book, you noticed the last two pages of the ritual instructions had been torn out. You knew this could only mean that a witch is present and attempting the ritual! As a Statari, you were horrified that  someone would even think of seizing that much power! You quickly ripped the  first page out for yourself - this is a good starting point, but you must find out  what the rest of the ritual entails and stop it at all costs!

Find the cannibal murderer AND stop the Imperium Ritual! It’s going to be a long night...","The late Count Veron Von Lucan - He seemed a nice chap - he did offer you a room when you came knocking at his door with your bogus cover story. To the best of your knowledge he never suspected your real identity.

Detective Samuel Ellacott - The detective has been acting strangely; he keeps checking his watch and eyeing the moon. As a supernatural expert, you think it’s very likely that he’s a werewolf, and it might be his first full moon.

Aunt Chastity - You’ve gotten along swimmingly with Aunt Chastity since arriving at the castle, which you take as a compliment since she doesn’t seem to like too many people. You two have had many late night chats. In fact, you had too much to drink last week and you revealed your true identity to her. She didn’t tell the Count as far as you know, and you think you can trust her.

Genevieve LeClerc - You’ve heard that Genevieve was a spy during the Great War - perhaps she knows some covert ways of gathering the information you need?","Take a careful look at the page of the IMPERIUM RITUAL that you have, and keep an eye out for anyone collecting similar items.

Be well versed on your ENCYCLOPEDIA. Knowledge is power (and leverage, and money), and it contains information that few others will have easy access to. (Nats note) include text of encyclopedia somewhere - this is not an item that can be stolen, bur rather an info dump on how supernatural things work)

You know your brother’s murder happened in America, so perhaps try and find out if anyone has a history there and question them further. Of course don’t forget to keep an eye out for the killers ‘calling cards’ - WHITE RIBBONS.

Avenge the death of your brother. Find the cannibal who killed Nathan and bring them to justice. This is vigilante justice, so you don’t need to provide  anyone else with proof, but you do need to take down the correct individual to  get your points. (15 POINTS)","3. Jazz Music. You have been pretty stressed out lately, and you’ve found  nothing relaxes you like good ol’ jazz music. Make sure jazz music is playing often  throughout the evening.

Lord,Edgar,Braithwaite,,A textile magnate and business rival to the late Count,,"Of course everyone expects you to be glad at the news of the Count’s death, but truthfully, you are heartbroken. It’s true that you and Veron had been bitter business rivals in the beginning, but, as so often happens in the textile industry, one kind of passion became another. You two struck up a secret relationship, and were very happy together for a number of years before his untimely death. And  you had hoped to be together for years, and years, and years - after all, you have  all the time in the world...

For you are the King Vampire of a great line dating back over five hundred years! You love being a vamp and would never want to go back to being human - who wouldn’t want to be immortal and very, very attractive? Well, Veron, apparently - he knew of your vampirism but you never were able to convince him to take the immortal plunge. Despite being King of the family, you’ve never really gone in for the whole vampire cause, and prefer to just enjoy the finer things in life. You yourself have no desire to create an army of vamps, or enslave the humans, or anything quite so dramatic. In fact, you haven’t created any new vamps in many years, but you’ve taken young vampire Kelly O’Brien under your wing as a protege. Kelly, on the other hand, is a very enthusiastic member of the undead, which works well for you. You’re happy for her to go about her vampire business as your right hand woman, while you benefit from the prestige of your position.

Unfortunately, your family is now threatened by a zealous hunter, dubbed ‘the slayer,’ who has recently been picking you off one by one. You’ve heard through your connections that the local werewolves have been targeted as well. Now all the vampires in town have either been killed or fled, except for you and Kelly.  Even without much loyalty to the vampire community, it pains you to see your  friends killed, and you can’t go on living your luxurious life when someone’s determined to put a stake through your heart. You’ve tasked Kelly with tracking down and killing the slayer. She can take care of that - seems right up her alley.","The late Count Veron von Lucan - Oh your dear Veron. You loved him very deeply. Of course you had the occasional squabble. You had recently offered to help him out financially by building a factory on some his land, but he was insulted that you would offer him charity and you two had a bit of a row. He could be a difficult chap but you loved him very much.

Kelly O’Brien - Kelly is really intense about the vampire thing. She is your second-in command and you leave her to do your vampire dirty-work. She knows  all the goings on in the castle, and she was first at the scene of the murder. It’s  probably in your best interest to see if she has any information the detective might  have missed.

Dr Josephine Murray - As mentioned, you just want to live in peace. Dr Murray knows you are a vampire and has access to plenty of blood. She regularly supplies you with as much as you need. Your stash is running low at the moment... ","Speak with the DETECTIVE and let him know you’re on side for solving the murder.

Being a vampire has always had its risks - there are always those who can’t wait to put a stake through your heart. Be careful who you share this information with.

You know of the SLAYER, and while this isn’t your main concern, unfortunately it is hard to ‘settle down’ with a stake through your heart. As head vampire, you’ve tasked KELLY O’BRIEN with taking care of the issue. Best to check in with her progress now and then.

KELLY was also the first on the scene of the crime - if you are going to figure out  who did this (and why), make sure to ask if she saw or found anything there.",You are a vampire - in fact you are the King of the Vampires in Dunkeldorf.,You and Count von Lucan were lovers.,"1. Solve the murder. You loved Veron dearly, so you want to know who would do such a terrible thing AND why. You receive 10 POINTS for being able to correctly identify the murderer at the end of the night, and 10 POINTS if you can correctly identify their motive.","2. Find someone to settle down with. You are mourning Veron deeply. So deeply in fact, that you could use a shoulder to cry on. Sure, it’s probably rushing into things, but you’re in pain, dammit. To soothe your aching heart, you  need to find a partner to settle down with for the rest of your long, long life.  Convince someone to marry you (you must be in possession of a MARRIAGE  CERTIFICATE signed by you and your future spouse) for 10 POINTS.  Additionally, if your future partner is an immortal (a vampire or by some other  means), get an additional 5 POINTS.","3. Pour Wine. In line with your lavish lifestyle, you are quite a wine connoisseur. Refill 3 people’s drinks throughout the night, and explain to them the delicate bouquet of the wine in excruciating detail (5 POINTS).",You must be a vampire at the end of the game.

Doctor,Josephine,Murray,,The late Count’s doctor,,"You are an excellent doctor, but your interest in anatomy goes beyond the professional and into the “gastronomical.” Yes, you are a CANNIBAL.

Hippocratic oath be damned, it’s a doc eat doc world out there, and your primary concern is for yourself and your appetite. Most of the time, you settle for the bits and pieces that your patients ask you to remove. But you have no moral qualms about killing to eat, and when the hunger gets too great, that’s just what you do.  Like any good serial killer, you make sure you leave a ‘calling card’ on your  victims: A WHITE RIBBON tied somewhere on your victims’ bodies. Creepy...

And you’re usually quite good at getting away with it. Unfortunately, you got sloppy in New York - you killed a man at your office. He was an out-of-towner, some sort of religious fellow named Brother Nathan Whetstone. He had just arrived to study some local church archives when he made an appointment with you for a standard check-up. You’d never had monk before, he was alone, and you just couldn’t resist the temptation, using your signature white ribbon and  everything. Looking back, you can’t believe you were so foolish - luckily you  were able to make it look like a wild animal attack and the case went unsolved.

Unfortunately it did alert your colleagues that something might be amiss, and  when they started raising a fuss, you thought it would be safer to leave the  country. You have been smarter about indulging since you’ve been here, and have  never killed a patient. But being careful means fewer meals, and you haven’t had a  real feast in months! 

You were actually quite pleased when the Count was killed - finally a meal had fallen right into your lap. Snacking on the dearly departed seemed a perfect way to quell your hunger without arousing further suspicion.

So you snuck out to the Von Lucan mausoleum the night after the burial.  Everything was going swimmingly - you had the Count halfway through the  woods in a wheelbarrow and he hadn’t even putrefied - when suddenly you felt  his hand grasp your own... the bastard had woken up! You don’t know what idiot  signed that death certificate, but they are a disgrace to the profession. Honestly,  what kind of lunatics will they let into medical school these days?

You pulled your hand from the Count’s, and as he struggled to escape his shroud, you turned and ran. You couldn’t tell for sure, but you think his burial bandages may have obscured his sight and kept your identity safe. When you arrived home, you realised you held in your hand an OLD SILVER RING set with a dark purple stone. You must have pulled it off the Count’s hand - shame it didn’t still have a finger in it. Some research revealed that the ring was an artefact, thought to be a myth, with the magical ability to bring people back from the dead. You are willing to bet this item would be worth quite a lot to the right people.

You had no idea of the Count’s whereabouts since the forest, so imagine your surprise when you saw his burial bandages again this very evening- on the face of the so-called “JOSEPH SHAW THE GROUNDSKEEPER”. Von Lucan has no doubt concealed his true identity to solve his own murder. Furthermore, you have heard rumours that someone has been asking around about WHITE  RIBBONS lately, but you don’t know who.

To top it all off, you STILL haven’t eaten, and the catering this evening isn’t what you’re craving... ","The late Count Veron Von Lucan - The count was 6 months overdue on his medical bills. He was in trouble financially and couldn’t pay, which didn’t leave you too enamoured with him.

Joseph Shaw - You know he is Veron Von Lucan in disguise, risen from the dead! You don’t know if he knows you were the one who dragged him out of his crypt.

Lord Edgar Braithwaite - Lord Braithwaite is a vampire. Your work allows you to order blood bags from the hospital, which you sell to him on a regular basis. His last visit was a while ago and you think his supply might be running low.

Genevieve LeClerc - Genevieve approached you the day she arrived in town.  She was a spy by during the Great War, and knows the value of having friends  with access to sensitive information. Though you haven’t known each other very  long, it seems you’ve become friends. You haven’t told her your darkest secret,  but you get the impression you are both like-minded, ambitious people, and you  feel as if you can trust her if you are ever in a pinch.","You are sure that JOSEPH SHAW is Veron Von Lucan - this could be a valuable piece of info that others might buy for the right price.  You have no idea if he saw you fleeing as he awoke in the woods - maybe strike up a conversation, but don’t give too much away.

You are troubled by the rumours that someone has been asking around about white ribbons - could someone be on to you? Try to find out who has been asking around - MEMBERS OF STAFF and OLD LADIES tend to gossip a lot.

The ring you picked up must be worth a pretty penny - scope out potential buyers but make sure you have a decent story to cover up your grave looting.",You are a cannibal!,You know for a fact Veron von Lucan is alive. He was brought back to life by the magical Lovers’ Ring.,"1. Eat as much flesh as possible! You will have 4 WHITE RIBBONS, each  worth 3 POINTS, which will signify that you have taken a bite of another players  flesh. Ribbons can ONLY be tied to an injured or unconscious player. When you  locate a suitably knocked-out player (or create one yourself), inform a host and  they will tie the ribbon somewhere VISIBLE on the player. Your identity will be  safe from your victim. Alternatively, you can tie a ribbon on an injured player  yourself for an additional 2 POINTS per ribbon, but be stealthy as you can be  caught in the act by others. (TOTAL OF 20 POSSIBLE POINTS)

You must place at least one ribbon in each of the 3 sections of the game. If you  neglect to do so, you will lose 10 points for each section you did not place at least  one.","2. Protect your Future.

Aunt,Chastity,Von Lucan,,"The late Count’s great Aunt, a long-time resident of the castle",,"But you’re not Great Aunt Chastity, are you? You are Great, Great, Great, Great, Great Aunt Chastity! You’ve kept a close eye on the family and the castle since 1632, because, well, you can’t die. 

In your youth, you fell in love with the dashing Alastair Hathaway, a handsome young man who, it turns out, was a witch. You two were to be together forever - Alastair told you that the Von Lucan land was a great source of power, and used it to enchant your engagement ring, a beautiful silver piece set with a deep purple stone, to grant you eternal youth. Tragically, Alastair was discovered as a warlock  and burned by the townsfolk the very next day. As time wore on, you realised  that while Alastair was quite a looker, he was only an okay lover and not a very  good warlock. The ring granted you immortality all right, but eternal youth was  not to be. Furthermore, the magic of the ring is bound to the land, so the ring has  no effect beyond the borders of the estate.

So you haven’t left at all in 250 years. In that time you have fended off werewolves, vampires, witches, and all sorts coming through your door in an attempt to control the power of the estate for themselves. Despite this, you don’t  have a problem with supernatural creatures in general, only those who would try  and take the castle from you. While you might not be as physically quick as you  used to be, you are no simpering old woman and are prepared for anything and  suspicious of everyone. 

But where were we... 
Ah yes - but your ring was stolen the day of Veron’s death! You know you haven’t  misplaced it - you’re not a brash young fool and you only remove the ring when  having your evening bath. 

The night of the murder: 
You had just finished bathing and were reading in bed when you heard of Veron’s death and rushed (relatively speaking), to the balcony to see for yourself. After giving a statement to police, you returned to your chambers, and that’s when you noticed the ring was missing. You don’t know if it was stolen during your bath or afterward in all the chaos. 

Of course you suspect it could have been anyone in the house at the time. But  who knows who has the ring now, as there’s been plenty of time for it to be  pawned off to the highest bidder!

You need that ring back! Without it, you’re a goner to the next werewolf or bout of pneumonia that comes around. Oh dear, is that a cough coming on?","The late Count Veron Von Lucan - He was an alright nephew - of course he didn’t take as much of your advice as you would have liked, and you were livid to learn he has squandered much of the family fortune and put the ownership of the estate at risk.

Elysia Von Lucan - Your great niece was always a smart girl. You don’t know if she ever really got over the death of her mother - the Countess Von Lucan was killed by a vampire when Elysia was only seven years old. Since she’s been back,  she’s been in and out at all hours of the night - you wonder what she is up to... 

Professor Nigel Montgomery - Now here’s a chap you really like. You rarely get a along with anyone, but he and you have got on swimmingly. You both got into the sherry a couple of weeks ago and he let it slip that he’s not actually who he says he is - he’s really a monk from a secret order called the Statari. How exciting! Of course you didn’t tell Veron, as the Professor is much better company than the Count ever was. His secret is safe with you and you feel like you two can trust each other. 

Joseph Shaw the Groundskeeper - Veron never told you he hired a groundskeeper, otherwise why would you have put the bloody ad in the paper?  Of course it is possible it just slipped Veron’s mind, but you still think it’s suspicious that this Shaw fellow turned up so soon after the Count’s death. Maybe  he’s after the money (what’s left of it), or the estate? You’ve seen your share of  creatures and their lackeys try to take this land, so you are on your guard","Since you suspect those staying in the house to have taken the ring, it might be good to start by speaking to them. Of course don’t limit yourself - it could be anywhere by now if someone has sold or lost it.

The castle deed is probably in high demand, there are most likely other people who want it.

You are worried about your health - it might be worthwhile to speak to DR MURRAY when you have a moment. ",You are 300 years old thanks to the power of the Lovers’ Ring - which renders the wearer immortal. ,"Prof Montgomery is secretly a monk; specifically a brother of the order of the Statarius, a sect of monks with an academic interest in the supernatural.","1. Find a way to remain on the Von Lucan estate. The ring’s magic only works within the borders of the estate.

Ms,Genevieve,LeClerc,,,,"As if being an elegant Frenchwoman who engages in casual espionage doesn’t make you interesting enough, you also happen to be a powerful and practised WITCH.

Born into a long line of witches you have always been careful to use your powers  to quietly make your way in the world without exposing yourself or your coven.  It was these powers that helped you survive, coerce and thrive during the war and  have kept you well-off ever since. 

But now, your powers and those of all witches world-wide have been waning. No one knows exactly why but with each generation, fewer children with the gift are born and those who are born with it struggle to develop their powers beyond that of basic and common parlour tricks. Witches’ powers are tied unequivocally to a 
thriving Earth and as humans continue to kill each other and the natural world around them, you suspect your powers are suffering along with it. The world is changing and not favourably for your kind - but you’re not the type of woman to sit back and watch that happen.

It is this that brought you to Braumburg Castle to seek out your old friend the Count in his place of residence. After much research, you discovered the castle lies over a geographical point from which all active supernatural energy emanates. No wonder the castle and the surrounding town are always heaving with supernatural activity. You wish to harness this power and wield it to restore the power of the witches. 

You broke into the Count’s library and discovered a dark spell that, when  correctly carried out by a witch, channels the power from the wellspring at  Braumburg Castle into said witch and affords her dominion over all supernatural  beings - the Imperium Ritual. With command of the supernatural races, you could  do anything you wanted - maybe even seek revenge on humans for the centuries  of persecution against your kind (get creative!). You were able to steal the last  two pages of the ritual, but you heard someone approaching and needed to leave,  fast. When you went back to retrieve the first page, it was gone - so someone  here tonight must have it.

 Knowing immediately you were faced with a difficult task, you worked some  magic and transformed a nearby floral teapot into a ‘familiar’ - a magical sidekick  with great skill and strength. You gave her the name Camille Simmons and a  cover story as your personal assistant. Plus, you two are really hitting it off as friends! You really know how to make ‘em…

But now to business - complete your dark task and the witches’ reign can finally  begin! ","The late Count Veron Von Lucan - You worked with the Count during The Great War passing sensitive information between interested parties. You often used book ciphers to communicate with each other. You would each have the same book (you recommend Bram Stoker’s Dracula: 5th Edition) and you would write to each other using coordinates of 3 numbers for each word. The numbers would indicate the page number, the line number and the word number for where the correct word appeared in the book. 

Dr Josephine Murray - You approached Dr Murray soon after you arrived in town. After all, as a spy you know the value of having friends with access to sensitive information. Dr Murray wasn’t put off by the idea, and though you haven’t known each other very long, it seems you’ve become friends. Though you haven’t told her about your supernatural plans, you get the impression you are both like-minded, ambitious people, and you feel as if you can trust her if you are ever in a pinch.

Professor Nigel Montgomery - He claims to be a professor of history but you suspect there’s more to him than that. You overheard him mention that aside from normal established history, he also has a bit of an interest in the occult.

Donald Lardaburger - As a spy you are always on the lookout for unusual behaviours. You noticed Lardaburger stumble a few times this evening, as if he were used to walking with a cane. 

Camille Simmons - She is your familiar, under cover as your personal assistant.  She is magically compelled to help you complete the Imperium Ritual, so you  know you can trust her to work with you. ","Pay close attention to the reading of the Count’s will. You have a feeling some of things you need for your ritual might be bequeathed to other people tonight. 

Be careful - your plan is ambitious and there may be some who wouldn’t be too  happy with you wielding the Imperium Power. Work with others to get what  you need, but keep an eye out for sabotage.

Whoever has the first page of the ritual probably has some idea of its significance - what will they do with it, and are they a friend or enemy? Has anyone been spending lots of time in the library?

Use your gifts wisely. Other players may come to you with their problems, which  is fine as you don’t mind lending a helping hand but just remember, you don’t  work for free.
