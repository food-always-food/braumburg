'You are Professor Nigel Montgomery, a professor of history and folklore at Oxbridge University.',
'But you’re not Professor Nigel Montgomery, are you?
<br>
Your real name is Brother Daniel Whetstone.  You are a member of the Order of the Statarius, a secret order of monks with an academic interest in cryptozoology.  You know that werewolves, vampires, witches, and myriads of other ‘supernaturals’ are all real and walking among us!  While many who have discovered the existence of supernaturals hope to destroy them, the Statari simply see them as equals trying to make their way in the world. While the order is peaceful whenever possible, they are extensively trained, and will not hesitate to kill if a threat presents itself.  The order is several hundred years old, and its members possess ancient and exhaustive knowledge in encyclopaedic tomes that they keep with them at all times.
<br>
Your older brother Nathan was a member of the order as well.  That is, until he traveled to New York to study some church archives there. Only a few days after he arrived, he was killed in what was deemed a ‘wild animal attack,’ the title often given to werewolf fatalities on official paperwork. The death was grisly - they weren’t able to recover all of your brother, but something about the official report didn’t sit right with you.  Nathan could have finished off a werewolf or vampire without breaking a sweat, so you know he must have been taken down by something entirely unexpected.
<br>
You got a hold of the case files, and as you suspected, things weren’t what they seemed. Most disturbingly, you’ve been able to piece together that the flesh removed from Nathan corresponded with traditional cuts of meat.  Yes, your brother was not only murdered, but eaten!  You may have seen your share of monsters, but cannibalism is just inhuman…
<br>
You followed a trail of similar murders, which has led you to believe the cannibal murderer is based here, in Dunkeldorf.  You travelled here about 2 months ago -  taking on a false identity to avoid alerting the killer to your investigation.  As a ‘professor,’ you can flaunt your supernatural knowledge without it seeming out of place.  You managed to blag your way into staying at the Von Lucan castle (and accessing its impressive library) by pretending to have been in the Count’s Oxbridge graduating class.  He didn’t call your bluff and seems to have been glad of the company.
<br>
Your main piece of evidence is the murderer’s ‘signature’ - each victim had PEPPA PIG PLASTERS left on their wounds, a humiliating parting gift from a deranged killer.  
<br>
You are disgusted and vengeful, and determined to find this cannibal.  Your investigation has cleared everyone in town of any guilt, except those here at the castle tonight! Funny how those things work out...
<br>
Though you wish you could focus on avenging Nathan, something else has been troubling you.  In the midst of some light reading in the castle library, you came across a book on the ‘Imperium Ritual’.  If completed during the full moon (which just happens to be tonight), this powerful ritual would give a witch (male or female), control over all supernatural creatures.  You’d have dismissed it as a curiosity, but as you flipped to the end of the book, you noticed the last two pages of the ritual instructions had been torn out.  You knew this could only mean that someone was attempting the ritual!  As a Statari, you were horrified that someone would even think of seizing that much power!   You quickly ripped the first page for yourself - this is a good starting point, but you must find out what the rest of the ritual entails and stop it at all costs!
<br>
Find the cannibal murderer AND stop the Imperium Ritual! It’s going to be a long night…',
'The late Count Veron Von Lucan:
He seemed a nice chap - he did offer you a room when you came knocking at his door with your bogus cover story.  To the best of your knowledge he never suspected your real identity.

Detective Samuel Ellacott:
The detective has been acting strangely; he keeps checking his watch and eyeing the moon.  As a supernatural expert, you think it’s very likely that he’s a werewolf, and it might be his first full moon. 

Aunt Chastity:  You’ve gotten along swimmingly with Aunt Chastity since arriving at the castle, which you take as a compliment since she doesn’t seem to like too many people. You two have had many late night chats.  In fact, you had too much to drink last week and you revealed your true identity to her.  She didn’t tell the Count as far as you know, and you think you can trust her.

Genevieve LeClerc:  You’ve heard that Genevieve was a spy during the Great War - perhaps she knows some covert ways of gathering the information you need?

'You have discovered someone is trying to complete the ‘Imperium Ritual’ this evening, which if completed would give them unlimited control over all vampires and werewolves.',
'Brush up on your encyclopaedia. You will have this with you as you play (and it can’t be stolen from you), but knowledge is power (and leverage, and money), so it is best if you have some understanding before you go in.  

You know your brother’s murder happened in America, so perhaps try and find out if anyone has a history there and question them further.  Of course don’t forget to keep an eye out for Peppa Pig plasters.

Take a careful look at the page of the Imperium Ritual that you have, and keep an eye out for anyone collecting similar items. ',
'Stop the Imperium Ritual - It would be extremely dangerous for someone to have power over all supernatural creatures.  You must ensure the ritual is not completed (20 points).  OR, if by some horrible circumstance the ritual is completed, you must find and kill whoever completed it to stop them wreaking havoc!',
'Avenge the death of your brother - Find the cannibal who killed Nathan and bring them to justice. This is vigilante justice, so you don’t need to provide anyone else with proof, but you do need to take down the correct individual to get your points.',
